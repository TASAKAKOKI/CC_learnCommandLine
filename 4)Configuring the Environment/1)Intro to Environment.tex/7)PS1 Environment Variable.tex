PS1 Environment Variable
    PS1 is an environment variable that defines the makeup and style of the command prompt.

    What happens when this is stored in ~/.bash_profile?
        export PS1=">> "
        
        export PS1=">> " sets the command prompt variable and exports the variable. Here we change the default command prompt from $ to >>.
        
        After using the source command, the command line displays the new command prompt.
        
    Let’s try it out!

Instructions
    1.
    Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.

    2.
    On a new line, beneath the last entry, set the PS1 variable equal to ">> " (make sure there is one space follow >>).

    Save the file and exit nano, and press Enter into a new line in the terminal.

    3.
    Use source to make the changes in ~/.bash_profile available. The command prompt should now look like >>

    4.
    Let’s try out the new command prompt. In the terminal, type:
        echo "hello" 

    5.
    Now type:
        ls -alt

    In the past two commands, did you notice that the command prompt has changed and is no longer $?
