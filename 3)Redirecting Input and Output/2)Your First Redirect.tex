Your First Redirect
How does redirection work?

$ echo "Hello" > hello.txt
The > command redirects the standard output to a file. Here, "Hello" is entered as the standard input, and is then redirected to the file hello.txt by > .

As a reminder, the cat command outputs the contents of a file to the terminal. When you type:

$ cat hello.txt
the contents of hello.txt are displayed.
