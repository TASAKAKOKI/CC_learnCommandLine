Introduction
    Up until now, we have run commands in the command line and received a stream of output in the terminal. In this lesson, we’ll focus on <<input and output (I/O) redirection>>.

    Through redirection <<you can direct the input and output of a command to and from other files and programs, and chain commands together in a pipeline>>. Let’s try it out.

    You can reference the filesystem for this lesson here.

    What happens when you type this command?
        $ echo "Hello"
        Hello

    The <<echo>> command <<accepts the string “Hello” as standard input, and echoes the string “Hello” back to the terminal as standard output.>>

    Let’s learn more about standard input, standard output, and standard error:
        1. <<standard input>>, abbreviated as <<stdin>>, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.

        2. <<standard output>>, abbreviated as <<stdout>>, is the information outputted after a process is run.

        3. <<standard error>>, abbreviated as <<stderr>>, is an error message outputted by a failed process.

    Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error to or from a different location.
