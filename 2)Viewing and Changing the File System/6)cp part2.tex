cp Part II
    To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument. Here, we copy the files file1.txt and file2.txt into the same directory.

    cp file1.txt file2.txt my_directory/ 
    Note that you can access the layout of the filesystem here.`
