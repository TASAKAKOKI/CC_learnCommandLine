rm
    The <<rm>> command deletes files and directories. Here we remove the file unwanted_file.txt from the filesystem.
        rm unwanted_file.txt
    
    The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The <<-r>> stands for <<“recursive,”>> and it’s <<used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.>>
        rm -r unwanted_directory
    
    Be careful when you use rm! It deletes files and directories permanently. <<There isn’t an undelete command, so once you delete a file or directory with rm, it’s gone>>.
