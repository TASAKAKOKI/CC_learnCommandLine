Introduction
    So far weâ€™ve used the command line to navigate the filesystem.

    We can view directories and files with more detail. We can also use the command line to copy, move, and remove files and directories. This lesson will explore these abilities!

    You can reference the filesystem for this lesson here. The file structure will stay mostly the same throughout this lesson.

Instructions
    1.
    To find out where we are in the file system right now, in the terminal, type    
        pwd
    
    2.
    In the terminal after the shell prompt, type
        ls 
    
    To view the files and directories contained in the current directory.
