cat
    How do we view the contents of an individual file in our terminal? We can use cat.

    The <<cat>> command outputs the contents of a specified file. For example:
        cat action/superwoman.txt
    
    will output all the text from superwoman.txt.

    This is a useful command for peeking at files without opening them, and confirming the result of other commands that change the contents of files.

Instructions
    1.
    In a single command, use cat to output what’s inside terminator.txt.

    Note: To accomplish this in one command, make sure you are writing a relative path from the current directory, movies/.

    2.
    In a single command, use cat to output what’s inside fight-club.txt.

    Note that there is nothing yet in the file, so the output should be empty.
