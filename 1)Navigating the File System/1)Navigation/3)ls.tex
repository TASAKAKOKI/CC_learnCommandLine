ls
    The first command we’re going to look at is <<ls>>. A command is a directive to the computer to perform a specific task. When you type ls, the command line <<looks at the directory you are in, and then “lists” all the files and directories inside of it>>.

    In the terminal, the first thing you see is <<$>>. This is called a <<shell prompt>>. It <<appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command>>.

    If we typed:
        $ ls
    
    the terminal would display our current directory’s files and directories:
        2014  2015  hardware.txt
    
    The directories blog, test, and the file index.js are the contents of the current directory.

Instructions

    In the terminal, after the $, type:
        ls 
    
    and press enter.

    You should see the three items print out below the command.
