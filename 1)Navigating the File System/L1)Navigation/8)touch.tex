touch
    Now we know how to create directories through the command line, but how do we <<create new files>>?

    We can do this using the command touch:
        $ touch keyboard.txt
    
    The <<touch>> command <<creates a new file inside the working directory>>. It <<takes in a filename as an argument and then creates an empty file with that name in the current working directory>>.

    Here we used touch to create a new file named keyboard.txt.

Instructions
    1.
    List your working directoryâ€™s current contents.

    2.
    Create a new file named keyboard.txt inside the working directory. If you list its contents again, you should now see your file listed.
